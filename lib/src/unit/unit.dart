/// A determinate [Quantity] (as of length, time, heat, or value) adopted as a
/// standard of measurement.
///
/// It is helpful to think of instances of this class as recording the
/// history by which they are created. Thus, for example, the string
/// "g/kg" (which is a dimensionless unit) would result from invoking
/// the method toString() on a unit that was created by dividing a
/// gram unit by a kilogram unit. Yet, "kg" divided by "kg" returns
/// [one] and not "kg/kg" due to automatic unit factorization.
///
/// This class supports the multiplication of offsets units. The result is
/// usually a unit not convertible to its {@link #getStandardUnit standard unit}.
/// Such units may appear in derivative quantities. For example Â°C/m is an
/// unit of gradient, which is common in atmospheric and oceanographic
/// research.
///
/// Units raised at rational powers are also supported. For example
/// the cubic root of "liter" is a unit compatible with meter.
